>>># ==     EQUAL 

This operator compares two values ​​(numbers strings, or Booleans) to see if they are the same ّ"Hello" - "Goodbye 'returns false ```because they are not the same string.
```' Hello 'returns true ``` because they are the same string  It is usually preferable to use the strict method:

 >>>># !=   NOT EQUAL

 IS NOT EQUAL TO This operator compares two values ​​(numbers, strings, or Booleans) to see if they are not the same. ``` Hello '!  = 'Goodbye' returns true ``` because they are not the same string. ```  Hello '=' Hello 'returns false ```because they are the same string.  It is usually preferable to use the strict method

 >>>># !== STRICT NOT EQUAL

 STRICT NOT EQUAL TO This operator compares two values ​​to check that both the data type and value are not the same. ``` '3' (ww 3 returns true ```because they are not the same data type or value. ``` '3' a '3' returns false ``` because they are the same data type and value.
 >>>># GREATER THAN
 operator checks if the number on the left is reater than the number on the right.
 ```
 4>3
 ```
 >>>># LESS THAN
 This operator checks if  The number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the righ
 >>>># GREATER THAN OR EQUAL
This operator checks if the number on the left is than the number on the right
```4>=3 `` returns true 

 >>>>#  les than or equal <=
 This operator checks of the number on the left is les than or equal to the number on the right restre & return false return true 3 3 return true

 >>># LOGICAL OPERATORS
 > Comparison operators usually return single values ​​of true or false.  Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

 >>>## &&
  > LOGICAL AND This operator tests more than one condition 
  ```((2 <5) && (3> = 2)```) returns true If both expressions evaluate to true then the expression returns true.  If just one of these returns false, then the expression will 
 ## ||   LOGICAL OR

 This operator tests at least one condition. 
 ``` ((2 <5) || (2 <1)) ```
 returns true If either expression evaluates to true, then the expression returns true.  If both return false, then the expression will return ```false```. 
 ``` true ||  true returns true true ||  false returns true false ||  true returns true false Il false returns false ```
 ## LOGICAL NOT

 >LOGICAL NOT This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. ``` !  (2 <1) 
 returns true ```
  This reverses the state of an expression.  If it was false (without the I before it) it would return true.  If the statement was true, it would return false
  ``` Itrue returns false Ifalse returns true```
