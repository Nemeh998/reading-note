# Who is Roy Fielding?
* He helped make the first web servers, as well as did most of the research for HTTP protocols.
# Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
* Techniques today don't work quite as well because the primary concern of Fielding's (and many other scientists at the time) research was to be able to reach any machine, anywhere in the world. Now that's not the primary concern.
# What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
* This can be thought of as an advanced GPS system, being able to tell exactly where the request and response is in the world.
# What does a GET do?
* GET sets an HTTP request to another machine from the client.
# What does a POST do?
* If one system needs to add something to another system it uses the HTTP "POST" command.
# What does PUT do?
* If one system needs to replace something in another system it uses the HTTP "PUT" command.
# What does PATCH do?
* If one system needs to do a partial update from another system is uses the HTTP "PATCH" command.
