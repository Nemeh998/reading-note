  #### how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
:checkered_flag: take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward
    

:checkered_flag: ask myself two questions:

 * What was the best part of the day?
 * What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
:checkered_flag: When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities – if I just stay with it
