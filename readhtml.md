> * The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple ```<div>``` elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

 >The ```<header>``` and ```<footer>``` elements can be used for:

The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
A header or footer for an individual``` <article>``` or``` <section>``` within the page.


#### Navigation ```<nav>:```
>*is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.


#### Articles```<article>```:
>* The element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
  
  #### Asides <aside>

 >* When the ```<aside>``` element is used inside an ```<article>``` element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning.
When the ```<aside>``` element is used outside of an ```<article>``` element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

#### Sections <section>
>*The ```<section> ```element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

CSS is a Cascading Style Sheet.it describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,through this we can change the presentation and not the structure.Declaration should be in property :value pair.Like HTML there are lots of properties in Css too.


### How to link CSS with HTML?
>* Inline: The Inline style is specific to the tag itself. The inline style uses the HTML “style” attribute to style a specific tag. This is not recommended, as every CSS change has to be made in every tag that has the inline style applied to it. The Inline style is good for one an individual CSS change that you do not use repeatedly through the site.

#### Example
```
<body>
<p style="color:red;margin-left:30px;">This is paragraph</p>
</body>
 ```
 >* Internal: An internal stylesheet holds the CSS code for the webpage in the head section of the particular file. This makes it easy to apply styles like classes or id’s in order to reuse the code.
 #### Example
 ```
 <head> 
<style type="text/css">  
h1 {color:blue;}  
h2 {color:red;}  
p {color:green;} 
</style>  
</head> 
```

## Doctypes
+ Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a doctypes declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. The use of a doctypes can also help the browser to render a page correctly.
#### comments in HTML
+ comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page, when you write your comments it will be easier to understand from your side and if someone else needs to look at the code.

#### id Attribute
+ The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet, It is used by CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a unique element.
 #### DIV
+ The div element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used div elements to hold each section of the page.
