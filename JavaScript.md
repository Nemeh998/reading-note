### what is the scrpit
+ A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
+ Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
+ To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 
### EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER
+ Access the content of the page
+ Modify the content of the page
+ Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
+ React to events triggered by the user or browser 
 
 # An expression 
>* ### there are two types of expressions. 
|  In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to begiven a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). |    
|---|---|
```
var color = 'beige'; 
```
| The value of co 1 or is now beige. When you first declare a variable using the var keyword, it is given a special value of undefined. This will change when you assign a value to it. Technically, undefined is a data type like a number,string, or Boolean. | 
|---|---|

>* ### EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
|You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For |
|---|---|
 ```
 var area = 3 * 2; 
 ```

|The value of area is now 6.Here the expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6. Thisexample also uses the assignment operator, so the result of the expression 3 * 2 is stored in the variable called area. |

### ARITHMETI C OPERATORS
>+ JavaScript contains the following mathematical
operators, which you can use with numbers.
You may remember some from math class.

 # USING S'TRING OPERATORS


>+ ### Java script
 ```
var greeting= 'Howdy ';
var name= 'Mol ly' ;
c02/js/string-opera tor.js
var welcomeMessage = greeting+ name+ '!';
var el = document.getElementByld('greeting');
el .textContent = welcomeMessage; 
```

>+ When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

##### Grouping together the statements that are required to answer a question or perform a task helps organize your code



>### A BASIC FUNCTION  

In this example, the user is shown a message at the top of the page. The message is held in an HTML element whose id attribute has a value of message. The message is going to be changed using JavaScript.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
Before the closing </body>
tag, you can see the link to the
JavaScript file. The JavaScript
file starts with a variable used
to hold a new message, and is
followed by a function called
updateMessage().
<ti t l e>Basic Function</title>
<l i nk rel ="stylesheet" href="css/ c03.css" />
</head>
<body>
<hl>TravelWorthy</ hl>
<div id="message">We lcome to our site! </ div>
<script src="js/ basic-function .js"></script>
</ body>
</ html> 
```



* These statements update the message at the top of the page. The function acts like a store; itholds the statements that are contained in the curly braces until you are ready to use them.Those statements are not run until the function is called. The function is only called on the last line of this script. 
```
var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!';
function updateMessage() {
var el = document.getElementByld('message'};
el .textContent = msg;
}
updateMessage(}; 
```

|to create the function you give it a name and direct statement needed to achieve a task inside the curly braces |
