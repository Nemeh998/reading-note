 # An expression 
>* ### there are two types of expressions. 
|  In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to begiven a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). |    
|---|---|
```
var color = 'beige'; 
```
| The value of co 1 or is now beige. When you first declare a variable using the var keyword, it is given a special value of undefined. This will change when you assign a value to it. Technically, undefined is a data type like a number,string, or Boolean. | 
|---|---|

>* ### EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
|You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For |
|---|---|
 ```
 var area = 3 * 2; 
 ```

|The value of area is now 6.Here the expression 3 * 2 evaluates into 6. Thisexample also uses the assignment operator, so the result of the expression 3 * 2 is stored in the variable called area. |

 # USING S'TRING OPERATORS


>+ ### Java script
 ```
var greeting= 'Howdy ';
var name= 'Mol ly' ;
c02/js/string-opera tor.js
var welcomeMessage = greeting+ name+ '!';
var el = document.getElementByld('greeting');
el .textContent = welcomeMessage; 
```

>+ When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.

>### Absolute URLs
| URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted tovisit that specific page.|      |
|---|---|
|An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site,and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display thehomepage.||

## Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page
If you want to link to a specific
part of a different page (whether
on your own site or a different
website) you can use a similar
technique.
As long as the page you are
linking to has id attributes that
identify specific parts of the
page, you can simply add the
same syntax to the end of the
link for that page.
Therefore, the href attribute
will contain the address for the
page (either an absolute URL or
a relative URL), followed by the
# symbol, followed by the value
of the id attribute that is used on
the element you are linking to.
For example, to link to the
bottom of the homepage of the
website that accompanies this
book, you would write:
<a href="http:/www.
htmlandcssbookcom/
#bottom">
